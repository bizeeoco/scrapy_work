"Why am I getting an E-mail with the subject line ""EIM removed a virus(es) from this message, it is safe to check the message/attachment(s)""? ","Email messages can not contain viruses. However, files that are attached to messages can contain viruses. EIM Mail Service provides free scanning of attachments to all subscribers who get incoming email through the web interface as well as to those who use POP3 through an E-mail client.,When you receive a message with a subject line that reads ""EIM removed a virus(es) from this message, it is safe to check the message/attachment(s)"" it means that the originator of that E-mail is infected with a virus and the attachment that was sent was effectively a virus. However, with EIM's Anti Virus Service in place it will automatically check the attachment for any known viruses.,If no viruses are found, the file will be downloaded as is. In case an attachment(s) is contaminated by a virus, the EIM Mail Anti Virus Service will remove the virus-contaminated attachment and replace it with a virus-free alert attachment explaining the name of the virus as well as any action(s) taken by the service. The original subject of the message will be modified to alert the recipient that a virus(es) was removed. The new subject line of the message will then look like this: ""EIM removed a virus(es) from this message, it is safe to check the message/attachment(s): "" and then the original subject is appended. This alert message is only sent to your email account if you opt to receive it. By default, this alert message is not sent to your EIM Mail account."",To provide the most comprehensive protection, viruses will be removed rather than simply cleaned. This is because when a virus is contained in an attachment, it may alter the information in the document before it can reach the anti virus software.
